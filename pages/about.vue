      <h1>About this project</h1>
      <p>
        COVID-19 is a major public health problem that has affected almost the
        entire planet, causing 12 million cases and more than 550 000 deaths
        (Public Health France).
      </p>
      <p>
        If most deaths are due to respiratory or cardiovascular failure, it
        quickly became apparent during the epidemic that the virus had a tropism
        for the central nervous system (Ellul et al. 2020). The nervous
        impairment seems to take many forms and its mechanisms, undoubtedly
        multiple, are being explored. Certain signs and symptoms plead for a
        direct viral attack of the nervous system: anosmia, meningitis and
        temporal necrotizing encephalitis resembling that of herpes (Moriguchi
        et al. 2020, Poyiadji et al. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        The detection of viral particles in the endothelium of the brain vessels
        argues for this direct role of the virus (Paniz-Mondolfi et al. 2020)
        and could explain the occurrence of strokes in young people (Oxley et
        al. 2020). Neuropathological studies are still few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relatively few autopsied cases and the lesions observed offer few
        arguments for direct action by the virus (Solomon et al. 2020). Ante-
        and post-mortem MRI imaging studies have reported multiple lesions
        associated with micro- spotting (Coolen et al. 2020). The hypothesis of
        secondary immune encephalitis has been raised in the face of multiple
        lesions of the white matter suggestive of ADEM (Reichard et al. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        Using postmortem MRI, subcortical micro and macro bleeds were reported
        (Coolen et al. 2020). Here, we propose a study combining ex vivo imaging
        by MRI and neuropathological study to elucidate the nature of the
        lesions observed in COVID + patients, their specificity, their
        pathophysiology whether it is directly linked to viral replication or
        secondary to the infection. Our study aims to link ex-vivo brain MRI
        signal abnormalities with neuropathological findings relative to the
        SARS-CoV-2 infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        MRI offers a “big picture” image on the whole organ compared to
        conventional histology, which is often limited to small sections. Here
        we will combine available techniques developed at both Institutes
        (Institut Pasteur and Paris Brain Institute - ICM) to facilitate the
        comparison and the characterisation of brain lesions linked to the viral
        infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project should produce a new description of the anatomical
        structures affected by the infection in the central nervous system, and
        in particular those related to the brain vascular system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight brains from COVID-19 patients will be studied and compared to
        matched controls. Autopsies will be performed according to the current
        procedure for interrogating the national refusal register (RNR),
        combined with the collection of testimonies from relatives on the wishes
        of the deceased and their information on the use of samples for
        research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sampling and storing will be done following the COVITIS protocol,
        approved by the authorized institutions (Agence de la Biomédecine PFS
        20-008; French ministry of research DC2020- 4022).
